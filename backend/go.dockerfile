# copies all files from the current directory (where the dockerfile is located) on your host machine into the /app directory inside the container --> essentially it includes your go application's source code in the docker image

#Download and install the go module dependicies specified in the go project
# -d: tells go get to only download the dependencies without installing them
# -v: enabled verbose output. provides additional information about the operations being performed by the command. This extra detail can be useful for debugging or understanding what the command is doing internally.

# a dockerfile is a script used by docker to automate the process of building a docker image. contains a series if instructions that docker uses to create a container image, which can then be run as a container
# for go applications, a dockerfile specifies how to set up the environment and build the go application within a docker container

#what is a docker image
#A Docker image is essentially a snapshot of a filesystem that contains everything required to run a particular application. Once an image is built, it doesnâ€™t change. This immutability ensures that the environment remains consistent across different deployments.
